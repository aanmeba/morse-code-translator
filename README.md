## Features

- Translation between English text and Morse code in both directions.
- **Properly handle spaces**: In the Morse code output, a `/` is used instead of a space between words in text, and there is a space between characters.
- **Validate input**: The application checks the validity of the input and remove any invalid characters.
- **Responsive design**: The web page is designed with a responsive layout, making it accessible and user-friendly across different devices and screen sizes.
